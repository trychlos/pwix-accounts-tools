|    1 | 2023- 9-13 | make sure that email address is unique inside of users collection ? |
|      | 2023-10-11 | according to https://docs.meteor.com/api/accounts, "an email address may belong to at most one user" |
|      |            | according to https://docs.meteor.com/api/passwords, "If there are existing users with a username or email only differing in case, createUser will fail" |
|      |            | so the point can be considered as acted |
